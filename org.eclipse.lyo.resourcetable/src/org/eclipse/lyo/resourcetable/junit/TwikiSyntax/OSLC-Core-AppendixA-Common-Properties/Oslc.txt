---+ OSLC Properties

These are the OSLC defined properties that are considered common.

   * *Namespace URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#=
   * *Suggested Namespace Prefix*: =oslc=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* ||
| =oslc:serviceProvider= | unspecified | Resource | Reference | =oslc:ServiceProvider= | A link to the resource's OSLC Service Provider. There may be cases when the subject resource is available from a service provider that implements multiple domain specifications, which could result in multiple values for this property. ||
| =oslc:instanceShape= | unspecified | Resource | Reference | =oslc:ResourceShape= | <p>The URI of a Resource Shape that describes the possible properties, occurrence, value types, allowed values and labels. This shape information is useful in displaying the subject resource as well as guiding clients in performing modifications. Instance shapes may be specific to the authenticated user associated with the request that retrieved the resource, the current state of the resource and other factors and thus should not be cached.</p> ||
| =oslc:shortTitle= | unspecified | XMLLiteral | n/a | n/a | Shorter form of =dcterms:title= for the resource represented as rich text in XHTML content. *SHOULD* include only content that is valid inside an XHTML &lt;span&gt; element. ||
| =oslc:shortId= | unspecified | String | n/a | n/a | Shorter form of =dcterms:identifier= for the resource, such as a number. ||
| =oslc:discussedBy= | unspecified | Resource | Either | [[OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA#oslc_Discussion_Resource][ =oslc:Discussion= ]] | A series of notes and comments about this resource. ||
| =oslc:modifiedBy= | unspecified | Resource | Either | Any | The URI of a resource describing the entity that most recently modified the subject resource. The link target is usually a foaf:Person or foaf:Agent, but could be any type. This is modeled after dcterms:creator, but Dublin Core currently has no equivalent property. ||
